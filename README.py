# 
# 
# The rysk python client offers a programatic means by which to interact with the [Rysk Finance Protocol](https://app.rysk.finance).
# 
# The DHV is a hybrid AMM and RFQ options protocol, generating uncorrelated returns for its liquidity providers whilst enabling anyone to trade (buy and sell) options with a wide range of strike prices and expiry dates. The DHV uses a dynamic approach in hedging risk to generate market-neutral uncorrelated returns for liquidity providers.
# 
# The Rysk client is a python client that allows users to interact with the [Rysk protocol](https://app.rysk.finance). The client is built on top of the web3.py and the [Open-Aea](https://github.com/valory-xyz/open-aea) python libraries. The client allows users to interact with the Rysk protocol in a programatic manner.
# 
# 
#

# ## Creating a Client 
# 
# Clients can be created from the rysk client module using python code.

# In[1]:


from rysk_client.client import RyskClient
from tests.conftest import DEFAULT_ADDRESS

auth = {
    "address": DEFAULT_ADDRESS,
}

client = RyskClient(**auth)
client


# ### Markets
# We can fetch data about the markets as so;

# In[2]:


markets = client.fetch_markets()
markets[0]


# ## Fetching Tickers
# 
# Tickers can be fetched from the client as so;

# In[3]:


tickers = client.fetch_tickers()
tickers[0]


# ## Fetching Positions

# 
# Positions are indicated by a vault id.
# 
# The vaultid iterates when a new position is created. 
# 
# Vaultid can be retrieved from;
# 
# 
# 
# 

# In[4]:


positions = client.fetch_positions()
positions[0]


# ## Dev & Contributing
# 
# Dependencies are managed with poetry.
# 
# For dev build.
# 
# ```bash
# poetry install 
# poetry shell 
# ```
